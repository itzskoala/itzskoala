I'm <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/skotala/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Sri</a>, a senior at the University of Minnesota majoring in computer science and advertising

I build and advertise whatever I can imagine.

Chances are if an idea pops in my head, I build it and post it here.

Relevant coursework:
- advanced data structures & algorithms
- data mining
- applied machine learning
- software engineering
- advertising strategy
- media design
- business analytics

I’m currently working on becoming accredited in digital advertising on coursera.

I’m looking to collaborate on business projects that utilize AI and ML.
